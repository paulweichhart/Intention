# Set Your Intention

This is the Repository of the Standalone  Watch App **Set Your Intention**. The App is available for free on the Apple Watch App Store — more information can be found here [www.paulweichhart.com/intention.html](https://www.paulweichhart.com/intention.html) 

This project serves as a Playground for getting started with Apple Health, Combine, SwiftUI & MVVM — I will update my MVVM & Coordinator Blog Posts in the coming weeks with more insights on the Design & Code decisions based on this Repository.
